## User Stories for a Taxi Website:
Customer:
As a customer, I want to easily book a taxi online so that I can quickly and conveniently arrange transportation to my desired destination. I expect to be able to see the available vehicles, estimate fares, track my ride in real-time, and provide feedback on the service, ensuring a seamless and satisfying travel experience.

Driver:
As a driver, I want to receive ride requests through the website, enabling me to efficiently manage my time and increase my earnings. I expect to have access to information about the pick-up location, destination, and fare estimates, allowing me to accept or decline requests based on my availability and preferences. Additionally, I look forward to receiving ratings and feedback from customers to improve my service quality.

Website Owner:
As the website owner, I aim to provide a reliable and user-friendly platform that connects customers with drivers, facilitating convenient and safe transportation services. I seek to optimize the booking process, manage driver-partners efficiently, and ensure customer satisfaction through features such as real-time tracking, transparent pricing, and feedback mechanisms. This will help in building a loyal customer base and attracting more drivers, ultimately leading to the growth and success of the business.
